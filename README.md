Ice Cream Island is a brain-stimulating puzzle game.  This project is still in the middle of pre-release development.

how it works
==============
The objective of each level is to match your board to the pattern on the goal board in the fewest moves or within the time limit, or both.

Every square on the board can contain one of three themed ice creams.  The player can move the selection to an adjacent square via arrow keys, clicking/tapping, or swiping.  The selection box cannot move diagonally.

When the player moves the selection to a different square, the kinds of ice cream in the previous and destination square determine the new kind of ice cream that will appear in the destination square.  

For example:

strawberry + chocolate = popsicle
chocolate + strawberry = popsicle
popsicle + chocolate = strawberry
strawberry + popsicle = chocolate

However, the destination square does not change if it is the same type as the previous square:

strawberry + strawberry = strawberry
chocolate + chocolate = chocolate
popsicle + popsicle = popsicle
